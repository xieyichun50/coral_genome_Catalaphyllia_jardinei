## scripts to generate the results
- To prepare files for evolutionary analysis, read [1ortholog_prep](https://github.com/xieyichun50/Myriapod-genomes/tree/main/script/1ortholog_prep)
- To generate synteny Oxford plots, read [2synteny_plot](https://github.com/xieyichun50/Myriapod-genomes/tree/main/script/2synteny_plot)
- To summarise the gene family evolution results, run `gene_family_coral.R`
- To annotate the gene/gene family functions, read [4function_anno2tree](https://github.com/xieyichun50/Myriapod-genomes/tree/main/script/4function_anno2tree)
- To regenerate the gene trees, read [genetree](https://github.com/xieyichun50/Myriapod-genomes/tree/main/script/genetree)

All required files can be found in `data`
